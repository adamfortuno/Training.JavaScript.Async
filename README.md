# Training.JavaScript.Async

Exploratory development in my learning of JavaScript and NodeJS. Artifacts here relate to handling of async. tasks.

References I used...

* [Async JS Crash Course - Callbacks, Promises, Async Await](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoRJizFvM7s): PHAT walkthrough of callbacks, promises, and async. awaits. I'm more of a book guy than a video guy, but this was the reference that made it click.
* [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/): Eh, this was "okay". Distracting analogy about Corvids with smart nests powered by insects. That said, it seems like a good reference.
